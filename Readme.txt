Note:

Currently, the last location function is not working. In order to find it use something like NBT explorer and seaarch for POS under the UUID you choose. Its still a work in progress and I'm planning on making the UI look a bit better. Its semi-functional ATM with the UUID and names but note, They must have joined the server at least one before & you need access to your playerdata folder along with your usercache.json file. 





In order to add the PlayerData make sure the folder is a .ZIP file.
